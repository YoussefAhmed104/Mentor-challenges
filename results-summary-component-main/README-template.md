### What I Learned

During this challenge, I improved my skills in:

- Structuring HTML for better accessibility.
- Styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts.
- Implementing dynamic content using JSON (if applicable).

Here’s a snippet of code I’m proud of:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Enhancing accessibility with ARIA attributes.
- Improving JavaScript functionality for dynamic content updates.
- Optimizing performance for better loading times.
